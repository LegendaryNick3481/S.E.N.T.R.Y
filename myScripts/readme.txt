STEPS TO RUN
---------------
1)LOGIN ONCE TO FYERS WEB (TO MAKE IT HASSLE FREE)
2)ENSURE DATABASE CONSISTENCY (CHECK IF BRICK CLOSE VALUES ARE ACTUAL CLOSES AND CORRESPONDS TO THE BRICK SIZE CHOSEN)
3)IN RESTOREDATA.PY CHANGE THE FROM AND TO DATES APPROPRIATELY
4)RUN MAIN.PY 5 MINS BEFORE MARKET START

NOTE
----
IF THE PROGRAM CRASHES IN B/W, RESTART WOULD BE VERY HARD (ONE WOULD HAVE TO EYEBALL IT TO THE NEXT
TIMEFRAME DUE TO THE NATUR OF THE RENKO BRICKS (10-20S BEFORE THE BEGINNING OF THE NEXT TIMEFRAME))
